        <dd>SCP-8500 is a virtual anomaly that appears as an interactive experience, where the user is assigned to oversee containment procedures for it. It involves two entities, implied to be previous supervisors, who both demand the user's attention within the virtual environment. The article itself is highly interactive and relies on a browser's HTML5 canvas support, suggesting it's designed to be a direct experience for the reader, blurring the lines between the document and the anomaly.</dd>

        <dd>Ebenezer Place in Wick, Caithness, Scotland, holds the Guinness World Record for being the shortest street globally, measuring only 2.06 meters (6 ft 9 in) long. It features a single address, the entrance to No. 1 Bistro, part of Mackays Hotel, which also fronts Union Street and River Street. The street was officially recognized in 1887, originating from a building constructed in 1883 whose owner was instructed to display a name on its shortest side. It gained its world record status in 2006, surpassing the previous record held by Elgin Street in Bacup, England.</dd>

        <dd>SCP-7182 is a powerful, expanding energy field that causes anyone or anything entering it to immediately fall into a deep, permanent sleep. This field mysteriously appeared around Site-08, a secret facility, and could not be dispelled by traditional means. It was discovered that the site director had been experimenting with powerful energy points, accidentally creating and amplifying this sleep-inducing field, which began to grow. A soldier named Walter Cread, who was uniquely immune to the field's effects, bravely volunteered to re-enter the affected site and destroy the machine amplifying the field, sacrificing himself to shrink it back to its original, manageable size and awaken everyone who had fallen asleep.</dd>

        <dd>The Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party (MKKP) is a satirical political party in Hungary, founded in 2006 and officially registered in 2014. The party uses humor and absurd campaign promises, such as eternal life, free beer, and building a mountain on the Great Hungarian Plain, to mock the political establishment and government policies. They are known for their street art and protest campaigns, often parodying government slogans, especially those related to anti-immigration stances. Despite its satirical nature, the MKKP has participated in elections, gaining increasing, though still small, percentages of votes, and has even won local council seats and a mayorship in Budapest, demonstrating a unique approach to political engagement through satire and anti-establishment messaging.</dd>

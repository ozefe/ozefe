        <dd>SCP-3526 is a phenomenon that occurs when a law is passed that makes the effects of a natural disaster illegal, such as a law against uprooting trees. If this happens, police and law enforcement in the area will be mentally compelled to treat natural disasters like tornadoes or floods as criminals, attempting to stop or "arrest" them using standard police equipment like cars and batons. This compulsion is so strong that officers will drive directly into deadly disasters, viewing it as their duty, which almost always results in their death. To prevent this, the Foundation works to stop any such laws from being passed anywhere in the world.</dd>

        <dd>A worknet is a concept describing an online space where a group of people and specialized applications come together to collaborate on a specific goal or project. Unlike social networking, which focuses on building personal connections, a worknet is task-oriented, bringing together the right people and the right tools for a single, shared purpose, such as co-creating a product or organizing an event. This approach aims to solve the problem of using many scattered applications and profiles by creating a single, focused environment that builds the trust and efficiency needed to work together effectively online.</dd>

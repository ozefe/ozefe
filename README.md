        <dd>SCP-1800-KO is not an object but a group of people who genuinely believe they are high-ranking members of the SCP Foundation's Korean branch. The anomaly is that their reality begins to collapse; their secret sites, personnel, and the hundreds of creatures they believe they are containing suddenly disappear, leaving them confused and stranded in a world where their organization never existed. The actual SCP Foundation discovers these individuals, designates them as the anomaly, and interviews them to learn from their extensive, albeit fictional, knowledge before administering memory-wiping drugs to ease their distress and allow them to live normal lives.</dd>

        <dd>"Pompatus" is a made-up word created by musician Steve Miller for his 1973 song "The Joker," where he mentions speaking of "the pompatus of love." The word itself has no actual meaning and is likely a misheard or altered version of another made-up word, "puppetutes," which was used in a 1954 doo-wop song called "The Letter" by Vernon Green. Green invented "puppetutes" to describe his ideal fantasy woman. Because of its mysterious and unusual sound, "pompatus" has captured public curiosity and has been referenced in other songs, movies, and books.</dd>
